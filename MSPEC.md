# An Introduction to Bi/Pan Lesbians

This page is meant to help explain why some people choose to identify as a bi or
pan lesbians and why those identities aren't harmful.

## Terminology

-   **Bisexual** attracted to two or more genders. Used throughout this document
    to refer to people who are attracted to both men and women, but it's
    important to note that not all bisexual women are attracted to men.

## The Definition of Lesbian

A lot of people are unaware of the actual definition of lesbian, or have been
taught a definition of lesbian which is fundamentally harmful. The term
"lesbian" was first used to refer to people or objects from the Greek island
Lesbos dating back to the 1500s. It wasn't until the 1700s that the word
"lesbian", in a reference to the poet Sappho who lived on Lesbos around 600 BC,
was used to refer to any woman who engaged in sexual activities with other
women.

The word lesbian has since then referred to all love relationships between
women, regardless of their sexuality. As such the word was frequently used by
bisexual women, seeing as they were - per the standing definition - lesbians as
well. Lesbian was also, along with words like dyke, used as a slur against
bisexual women and exclusively lesbian women alike.

It wasn't until the late 1960s that a new but somewhat similar definition for
the word lesbian was proposed.

## Political Lesbians

In the late 1960s radical feminists proposed that cis straight women should
identify as lesbians to say that they were unavaiable to men. This introduced an
additional definition of lesbian, to mean "woman who is not attracted to men".

This definition no longer had anything to do with women being attracted to women
and excluded all women who were also attracted to men. Most lesbians -
especially bisexual lesbians - rejected this definition, but biphobic lesbians
saw this as an opportunity to permanently exclude bisexual women from lesbian
spaces.

(Clarify that this definition is lesbophobic and biphobic?)

(Explain how "lesbians cannot be attracted to men" hurts bigender people,
genderfluid people, and trans women)
