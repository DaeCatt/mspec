# An Introduction to M-spec Lesbians

[MSPEC.md](MSPEC.md) contains a work in progress document detailing why and how
the lesbian identity can intersect with m-spec identities like bisexual,
pansexual, and omnisexual. The goal is to have a simple page to link to when
people claim that you cannot be m-spec and lesbian or to link to when people ask
what it means to be an m-spec lesbian.
